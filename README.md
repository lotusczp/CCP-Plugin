# CCP-Plugin
This repository is for the CCP (CAN Calibration Protocol) master plugin, which must be used by the [lobster](https://github.com/lotusczp/Lobster) main program.

This repository is currently obsolete. We actually have implemented XCP over CAN protocol, which is a little different from CCP. Please refer to [XcpCan](https://github.com/lotusczp/XcpCan-Plugin) plugin
